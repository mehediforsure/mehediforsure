                <p>As a musician, I started my musical journey in 2020 from a prison in Bangladesh. 
                    I was associated with a Bangladesh based renowned band — Kaaktaal in the beginning.
                    I used to sing and play guitar(Sometime, I still do). 
                    But as Roygbiv, I use non-traditional electronic instrumentation and sound manipulation technology as the primary backbone of my compositions. 
                    Mostly My Computer and A program called Ableton Live. I sometime make my own samples from a program called Renoise. They are non traditional, at least where I live.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A link of my music is given on the upper right side Roygbiv button. Cheers.
